Totals at `main` = `a0f342b`: **32/32 Vitest**, strict `tsc -b`, production build — green. Pester runs outside Node CI by design; its 17/17 fixture-only result is documented in `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-RUNBOOK.md`.

**Do not update statuses without direct evidence.** Each row above cites its merge SHA, its post-merge CI run on `main`, and its independent review verdict. Distinguish PR opened, approved, and merged — all three are complete for TASK-01/02/03.
